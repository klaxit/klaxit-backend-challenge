# Klaxit backend challenge

Looking for a job? Check out our [open positions](https://klaxit.workable.com).

If you want to join Klaxit backend team, here is the best way to prove your skills!

## Quick intro

You are building a carpooling service where...

- Any user can be a driver or a passenger,
- A ride includes a driver and a passenger,
- The passenger "cost" is transferred to the driver as a "profit",
- Sponsorships can be applied to reduce passenger cost.

Completing the 3 levels, you will implement all these mechanisms.

## Guidelines

For each level, write code that creates a new `level*/output.json` file from the `level*/input.json` file. A `level*/expected_output.json` file is available to give you a reference on which output is expected at each level.

- Clone this repo (please **do not** fork it),
- Solve the levels in ascending order,
- Keep only one commit per level,
- You can use Ruby, Golang, Python or Node.JS,
- Calling `make` should execute your code (see `Makefile`),
- Do not use external dependencies (please stick to your language Standard Library),
- You can split your code in multiple files.

## Send us your achievement

Bundle the whole project with `make bundle`, and send it to us (by email if you are already in contact with us or by uploading it while applying to an [open position](https://klaxit.workable.com)).
