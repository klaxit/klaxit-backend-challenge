# Level 3

## Guidelines

We want passengers to pay less !
* Pricing model is the same as level 2,
* Passenger `cost` on each ride can be reduced by sponsorships (not below zero!),
* Sponsorship(s) apply to passengers with home OR work coordinates in the `eligibility_bbox`
  which is an array of `((min_lat, min_lng), (max_lat, max_lng))`,
* Sponsorship(s) reduce each passenger's ride `cost` by an `amount`,
* Sponsorships can be cumulated by a passenger on a single ride.

Output each user total `cost` and `profit`.

## Notes

- Distances are expressed in meters
- Cost and profit are expressed in cents
